    "PAG operates within a governance ecosystem aligned with group-level corporate doctrine and applicable regulatory frameworks in its jurisdictions of incorporation and operation.",
    "This governance model supports delegation discipline, risk control, compliance oversight, and financial accountability while preserving clear separation between structuring authority and execution responsibility.",
    "Mandate governance is supported by documented approval pathways, contractual obligation mapping, counterparty due diligence checkpoints, and escalation protocols for delivery or compliance deviations.",
    "Execution oversight is bounded by defined authority limits: PAG coordinates mandate structure, partner alignment, and governance continuity, while designated operators retain direct delivery accountability within their assigned scopes."
